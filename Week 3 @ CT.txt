Talk about drinking through a fire hose!

It has been a hell of a week. I think I am getting the main points, but some of the details still escape me. I feel confident I will get there with more practice though. 

I finished Module 2 and am going to take a break before continuing to Module 3 as I have been very sick the past few days and need some rest.
