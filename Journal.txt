8/11/2024 - Wrapping up module 1. So far all seems to be going well enough. A few hiccups along the way, but nothing to worry over. Ready to start coding!
8/13/2024 - Finally getting through the first lesson of the second module. It has been a slow couple of days as I adjust to learning Python. But, I am starting to get into a groove!
8/14/2024 - I got full credit on my first real coding assignment today with awesome feedback from my reviewer. I am feeling like I am really getting the hang of things. Didn't make as much progress on my lessons as I would like, but I feel like I'm really absorbing the material.
8/17/2024 - I took the last couple of days off to rest my brain. I was beginning to experience a lot of fatigue working on the lessons. Got back at it today and completed lesson 2 of module 2.
