8/11/2024 - Wrapping up module 1. So far all seems to be going well enough. A few hiccups along the way, but nothing to worry over. Ready to start coding!
8/13/2024 - Finally getting through the first lesson of the second module. It has been a slow couple of days as I adjust to learning Python. But, I am starting to get into a groove!
8/14/2024 - I got full credit on my first real coding assignment today with awesome feedback from my reviewer. I am feeling like I am really getting the hang of things. Didn't make as much progress on my lessons as I would like, but I feel like I'm really absorbing the material.
8/17/2024 - I took the last couple of days off to rest my brain. I was beginning to experience a lot of fatigue working on the lessons. Got back at it today and completed lesson 2 of module 2.
8/21/2024 - Been a few days since I added an entry. It's been a busy week and I've been sick, but I've made progress on module 2. I learned the basics of list, loops, functions, strings, and exception handling. I am going to work on the mini-project tomorrow.
8/22/2024 - I finished module 2 and feel confident that I can navigate lists while performing functions and loops.
8/28/2024 - Took the past few days off as I was very sick and needed to recover. Got back at it with learning about dictionaries in Python. I am trying hard to wrap my head around everything, but feel I may need to refresh myself on some of the basics before continuing too far.
9/17/2024 - Has it really been nearly three weeks since I checked in? Wow! I haven't covered a lot of the course, but I worked on my CodeWars and got that going. I'm also wrapping up module 3. It's been a whirlwind. Trying hard to keep track of all the different data types from strings, integers, and boolean to lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
9/17/2024 - This is my first entry using a program with file handling.
9/18/2024 - I spent the day working on my file handling assignment, but I am having trouble with permissions. I need to wait for some help from my coach.
9/18/2024 - I heard back from Travis, my coach. With a little help, I was able to correct the issue I was facing and get my program running. On to the mini-project tomorrow!
